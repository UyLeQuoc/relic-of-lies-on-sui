## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18 (LTS recommended)
- **Bun** 1.2.23 (package manager)
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Sui CLI** for smart contract development
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd relic-of-lies
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` files in each app directory
   - Configure database connection
   - Set up Sui network configuration (testnet/mainnet)
   - Configure API keys and service endpoints

4. Set up the database:
```bash
cd apps/api
bun run prisma migrate dev
bun run prisma generate
```

5. Deploy smart contracts (if needed):
```bash
cd apps/contract
sui client publish
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Run All Apps

Start all applications in development mode:

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Run Specific Apps

Start only the frontend:
```bash
turbo dev --filter=web
```

Start only the backend:
```bash
turbo dev --filter=api
```

### Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start all apps in development mode
- `bun run build` - Build all apps and packages
- `bun run lint` - Lint all code
- `bun run check-types` - Type check all TypeScript code
- `bun run format` - Check code formatting
- `bun run format:fix` - Fix code formatting issues

### App-Specific Scripts

#### Web App
```bash
cd apps/web
bun run dev          # Start Next.js dev server
bun run build        # Build for production
bun run codegen      # Generate GraphQL types
```

#### API
```bash
cd apps/api
bun run dev          # Start NestJS dev server
